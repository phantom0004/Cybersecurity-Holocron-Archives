# Overview
VulnraWeb was a deliberately vulnerable web server designed to help beginners learn and practice ethical hacking concepts. It provided an interactive platform for users to test their knowledge on various vulnerabilities, including:

- Brute forcing
- SQL injection
- Command injection
- And more

This project aimed to be an educational tool for aspiring ethical hackers, offering hands-on experience in a controlled environment.

# Challenges
While there were no inherent issues with the project, it faced challenges that hindered its continuation:

- Limited Visibility: VulnraWeb struggled to gain traction and was overshadowed by larger, more established projects in the field.
- Reduced Motivation: The lack of visibility diminished my enthusiasm for further development, ultimately leading to the projectâ€™s halt.

# Future Potential
VulnraWeb had the potential to become a valuable resource for cybersecurity education if further developed and marketed. The concept remains promising and could be revisited in the future with more features and broader outreach.
