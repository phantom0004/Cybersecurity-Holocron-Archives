# Overview
Th3Infiltrator_MITM was a promising project focused on [briefly describe the project's purpose or functionality, e.g., "man-in-the-middle attacks for testing network vulnerabilities"]. While heading in the right direction, the program required significant testing and updates to address various issues in both its implementation and overall functionality.

# Challenges
- Code Complexity: With nearly 1000 lines of unstructured code, the sheer size made it difficult to maintain and debug effectively.
- Development Hurdles: Although there were no inherent flaws in the projectâ€™s concept, several modifications and improvements were needed to enhance reliability and usability.

# Future Potential
Th3Infiltrator_MITM is not truly "dead" but serves as a boilerplate for potential future projects. Lessons learned from this development, particularly the importance of structured and maintainable code, will guide future endeavors in this domain.
