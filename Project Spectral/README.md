# Overview
Project Spectral was an ambitious attempt to create a [briefly describe the project's core purpose or functionality]. While the initial concept showed promise, the project ultimately fell short due to a combination of knowledge gaps, hardware limitations, and implementation challenges.

# Challenges
- Hardware Limitations: Running the required models locally proved to be resource-intensive and prohibitively expensive.
- Knowledge Gaps: Certain technical aspects of the project exceeded the current scope of expertise, presenting significant hurdles.
- API Complexity: While integrating an API for this task offered partial success, it introduced additional layers of complexity that further hindered progress.

# Future Potential
Despite these challenges, the concept behind Project Spectral remains a compelling idea for future development. With advancements in hardware, reduced costs, and further exploration of API integrations, a refined version of this project could become feasible.
