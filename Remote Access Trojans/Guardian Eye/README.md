# Overview
Guardian Eye was my first attempt at developing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in Python. The project served as an incredible learning experience and an eye-opener into the complexities of such tools. However, it ultimately became overly complex and impractical due to several limitations and challenges.

# Challenges
- Limited Python Knowledge: Being my first project of this nature, the codebase quickly became unwieldy and difficult to manage due to poor structure and lack of experience.
- No Secure Communication: The program lacked secure communication channels, making it unrealistic for use in actual attacks as it offered minimal effort to conceal the attackerâ€™s identity.
- Feature Limitations: Functionality was basic and restricted, significantly limiting the program's capabilities compared to more sophisticated RATs.

# Future Potential
- Guardian Eye highlighted the importance of secure coding practices, modular design, and the necessity of robust communication protocols. While this project is being archived, it remains a stepping stone toward better-developed and more advanced projects in the future.
